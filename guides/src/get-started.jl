# HomotopyContinuation.jl aims at having easy-to-understand top-level commands.
# For instance, suppose we want to solve the following polynomial system
# ```math
# f=\begin{bmatrix}x^2+2y \\\\ y^2-2 \end{bmatrix}
# ```
#
#
# This can be accomplished as follows
#
using HomotopyContinuation
@polyvar x y; # declare the variables x and y
#md solve([x^2+2y, y^2-2], report_progress=false) #hide
result = solve([x^2+2y, y^2-2])

#
# Let us see what is the information that we get. Four paths were attempted to be solved, four of which were completed successfully.
# Since we tried to solve an affine system, the algorithm checks whether there are solutions at infinity: in this case there are none. With *solutions at infinity* we mean solutions of the [homogenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial#Homogenization) of the system which are no solutions of the affine system. None of the solutions are singular and two of them are real. To access the first solution in the array we write

result[1]

## Assume we are only interested in the *real* solutions. We can obtain these by
real(result)

# where we can see that there are 2 real solutions, ``(2^{\frac34},-\sqrt{2})`` and ``(-2^{\frac34}, -\sqrt{2})``. We also can look into more detail into the first result by
#

first(real(result))

# The `return_code` tells us that the path tracking was successfull.
# What do the other entries of that table tell us? Let us consider the most relevant:
#
#   * `solution`: The approximate zero that is computed (here it is ``(2^{\frac34},-\sqrt{2})``).
#   * `accuracy`: An estimate for the distance of the approximate zero to the true solution.
#   * `residual`: The computed value of ``||f(x)||â‚‚`` where ``x`` is again our approximate zero.
#   * `condition_jacobian:`: The [condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number) of the Jacobian of  ``f``` a the solution.
#
# To extract the solutions you can do
#

solutions(result)

#
# or if you only want real solutions
#

realsolutions(result)

# This should be enough to get you started. There are [more guides](https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/guides/) available as well the [documentation](https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/HomotopyContinuation.jl/stable/) of the API.

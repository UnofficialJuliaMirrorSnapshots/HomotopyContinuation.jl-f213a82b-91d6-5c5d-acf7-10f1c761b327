An affine patch is a hyperplane defined by ``vâ‹…x-1=0``.

This holds the actual patch information. `N` indicates the number of products of projective spaces.

Number of equations an affine patch adds.

Construct the state of the path from `x`.

Scale a vector `x` such that it is on the affine patch.

Setup the affine patch depending on `x` and modify `x` if necessary.

The same as [`setup!`](@ref) but only called during the path tracking.
